# Git-Best-Practices---Start-to-Finish-Processes-
This repository contains best practices from start to finish to ensure clean, collaborative and production-ready code - especially in professional environments. My intention is to provide a clear and practical overview of Git best practices for managing projects efficientlyâ€”from repository setup and branch strategies to commit conventions, pull requests, and release tagging. Whether you're working solo or on a team, you'll find actionable tips to keep your codebase clean, secure, and production-ready.

Use this as your go-to reference for building scalable workflows, writing meaningful commits, and maintaining a professional Git history across development, testing, and deployment stages.
