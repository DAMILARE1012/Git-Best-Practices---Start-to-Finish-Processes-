# Git-Best-Practices---Start-to-Finish-Processes-
This repository contains best practices from start to finish to ensure clean, collaborative and production-ready code - especially in professional environments. My intention is to provide a clear and practical overview of Git best practices for managing projects efficiently—from repository setup and branch strategies to commit conventions, pull requests, and release tagging. Whether you're working solo or on a team, you'll find actionable tips to keep your codebase clean, secure, and production-ready.

Use this as your go-to reference for building scalable workflows, writing meaningful commits, and maintaining a professional Git history across development, testing, and deployment stages.

###🧱 1. Initialize Your Repository Properly

Start by creating a new project folder and setting up Git:

```
# Create a project folder
mkdir my-awesome-project

# Move into the folder
cd my-awesome-project

# Initialize an empty Git repository
git init
```

#### Structure after initialization:
```
my-awesome-project/
├── .git/         ← Git tracking info
└── (your files)
```
