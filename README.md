## ⚙️ Quick Setup Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet outlines the step-by-step Git flow to initialize a project, push it to GitHub, collaborate through branches, and release it cleanly.

### 🛠️ Initialize Git (inside your project folder)

**Step 1: Create your project folder and move into it**
```bash
mkdir your-project-folder
cd your-project-folder
```

**Step 2: Initialize Git inside this folder**
This creates a hidden `.git/` directory to track your changes.
```bash
git init
```

**📁 Folder structure after setup:**
```
my-awesome-project/
├── .git/         ← Git tracking info
└── (your files)
```

**Step 3: Create a .gitignore file**
Tell Git which files/folders to ignore (e.g., we don't want to track `.env` files because they may contain secret credentials)
```bash
echo "*.env" > .gitignore
```

**Step 4: Stage all changes in the current directory for commit**
This includes new files, modified files, and deleted files (excluding what's in `.gitignore`)
```bash
git add .
```

**Step 5: Make your first commit with a descriptive message**
```bash
git commit -m "chore: initial project setup"
```

**Step 6: Connect to remote repository**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

**Step 7: Push to remote repository**
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## 🌳 Branching Strategy

Use a clear branching strategy to organize your work using a consistent branching model:

| **Branch Name**     | **Purpose**                            |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `main` / `master`   | Production-ready, stable code          |
| `dev`               | Active development base                |
| `feature/*`         | New feature branches                   |
| `bugfix/*`          | Patches or fixes                       |
| `release/*`         | Prepares for production release        |
| `hotfix/*`          | Urgent fix on live product             |

## ✍️ Write Meaningful Commits

Keep commits focused and consistent using conventional commit messages:

| **Type**     | **Description**                                    |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `feat`       | ✨ New feature                                    |
| `fix`        | 🐛 Bug fix                                        |
| `docs`       | 📚 Documentation-only changes                     |
| `style`      | 💅 Formatting, no code logic change              |
| `refactor`   | 🔨 Code restructuring                             |
| `test`       | ✅ Adding or updating tests                       |
| `chore`      | 🔧 Maintenance tasks (e.g., deps, CI)            |

**✅ Example:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add login endpoint with token-based auth"
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔄 Pull Request/Merge Request Workflow

Follow these steps for collaborative development:

**Step 1: Create a feature branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
```

**Step 2: Make your changes and commit**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement user authentication with JWT"
```

**Step 3: Push the branch to remote**
```bash
git push -u origin feature/user-authentication
```

**Step 4: Create Pull Request**
- Go to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
- Click "New Pull Request" or "New Merge Request"
- Select your feature branch → main branch
- Add descriptive title and description
- Request code review from teammates

**Step 5: Code Review Process**
- Address reviewer feedback
- Make additional commits if needed
- Keep discussions focused and constructive

**Step 6: Merge after approval**
- Use "Squash and merge" for clean history
- Delete the feature branch after merge

## ⚔️ Conflict Resolution Basics

When Git can't automatically merge changes, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Identify conflicts**
```bash
git status
# Shows files with conflicts
```

**Step 2: Open conflicted files**
Look for conflict markers:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Incoming changes
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

**Step 3: Resolve conflicts manually**
- Edit the file to keep desired changes
- Remove conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
- Test that your code still works

**Step 4: Stage and commit resolution**
```bash
git add conflicted-file.js
git commit -m "fix: resolve merge conflict in user authentication"
```

**Step 5: Continue with merge/rebase**
```bash
git rebase --continue
# or
git merge --continue
```

---

## 🔧 Interactive Rebase for Commit Cleanup

Clean up your commit history before merging:

**Step 1: Start interactive rebase**
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Last 3 commits
```

**Step 2: Choose actions for each commit**
```
pick f7f3f6d feat: add login form
squash 310154e fix: typo in login form
reword a5f4a0d feat: add validation
```

**Common actions:**
- `pick` - Keep commit as is
- `squash` - Merge into previous commit
- `reword` - Edit commit message
- `drop` - Remove commit entirely

**Step 3: Edit commit messages**
- Git will open editor for each reworded commit
- Write clear, descriptive messages

**Step 4: Force push (if already pushed)**
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/user-auth
```

## 📋 Semantic Versioning for Releases

Follow semantic versioning (SemVer) for consistent releases:

**Version Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

| **Version Type** | **When to Use**                        | **Example** |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------|
| **MAJOR**        | Breaking changes                        | `1.0.0 → 2.0.0` |
| **MINOR**        | New features (backward compatible)     | `1.0.0 → 1.1.0` |
| **PATCH**        | Bug fixes (backward compatible)       | `1.0.0 → 1.0.1` |

**Step 1: Tag a release**
```bash
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release version 1.2.3: Add user dashboard"
```

**Step 2: Push tags to remote**
```bash
git push origin v1.2.3
# or push all tags
git push origin --tags
```

**Step 3: Create GitHub release**
- Go to GitHub → Releases → New Release
- Select your tag
- Add release notes describing changes
- Attach binaries if needed

**Step 4: Automate versioning**
Consider tools like:
- `semantic-release` for Node.js
- `commitizen` for conventional commits
- GitHub Actions for automated releases

## 🎯 Final Tips for Professional Git Use

- **🔒 Security:** Don't commit `.env`, `.pem`, or secret files
- **📋 Documentation:** Add a `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` to every project
- **🧪 Automation:** Automate tests via GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins
- **👨‍🏫 Education:** Educate collaborators on your Git workflow
- **🔄 Regular Updates:** Keep your local repository in sync with remote changes
- **📝 Clear Messages:** Write commit messages that explain the "why" not just the "what"

Happy coding! 🎉🔧📦
