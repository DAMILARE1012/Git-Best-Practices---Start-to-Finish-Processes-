# Git-Best-Practices---Start-to-Finish-Processes-
This repository contains best practices from start to finish to ensure clean, collaborative and production-ready code - especially in professional environments. My intention is to provide a clear and practical overview of Git best practices for managing projects efficiently‚Äîfrom repository setup and branch strategies to commit conventions, pull requests, and release tagging. Whether you're working solo or on a team, you'll find actionable tips to keep your codebase clean, secure, and production-ready.

Use this as your go-to reference for building scalable workflows, writing meaningful commits, and maintaining a professional Git history across development, testing, and deployment stages.

#### Quick overview of what to use to setup a project from start to finish.
```
# Initialize project
git init
echo "*.env" > .gitignore
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial project setup"

# Create a remote repo and connect
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/project.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Create a feature
git checkout -b feature/user-auth
# Work and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement JWT-based login"
# Push and open PR
git push -u origin feature/user-auth

# Review, squash & merge into dev/main
# Tag release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Add authentication module"
git push origin v1.0.0

```

<hr>
**üß±1. Initialize Your Repository Properly**

Start by creating a new project folder and setting up Git:

```
# Create a project folder
mkdir my-awesome-project

# Move into the folder
cd my-awesome-project

# Initialize an empty Git repository
git init
```

#### Structure after initialization:
```
my-awesome-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/         ‚Üê Git tracking info
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (your files)
```
<hr>
**‚úÖ2. Set up a .gitignore - From (your files), define some of the files that you don't want to be exposed to 3rd parties 

```
# Example: .gitignore for Python:
*.pyc
__pycache__/
.env
venv/
*.sqlite3
*.log
.DS_Store
.idea/
*.egg-info/

```
<hr>

**Follow a Clear Branching Strategy**
- Common structure:
  - main or master: Stable production-ready code
  - dev: Ongoing development
  - feature/feature-name: Individual features
  - bugfix/bug-description: Bug fixes
  - release/x.y.z: Release preparation
  - hotfix/x.y.z: Emergency fixes
 
**Write Meaningful Commit Messages**
My Advice - Commit often but smartly. Small, focused commits are easier to review and revert. Also dont forget to track your changes so as to avoid committing secrets or generated files (.gitignore is very important at this juncture).
Here are different types of communit and how you can use them effectively.
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation change
- style: Formatting (no logic change)
- refactor: Code restructuring
- test: Adding tests
- chore: Maintenance tasks (e.g. deps)

```
# Example:
git commit -m "feat: add login endpoint with token-based auth"
```

<hr>
‚úÖ Use Pull Requests (PRs) and Code Reviews
Never commit directly to main in team projects

Open a PR from feature/* or bugfix/* to dev or main

Ensure tests pass and reviewers approve before merging

Use descriptive PR titles and checklists
<hr>

Tag Your Releases
Use semantic versioning:
```
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

<hr>
Sync with Remote Regularly
```
git pull origin dev      # fetch and merge
git push origin feature/my-feature
```
